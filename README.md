# Database-project
So, my goal is to emulate an inventory control management database to better understand how to maintain a proper variety of required items, increase inventory turnover, reduce, and maintain optimize inventory and safety stock levels, obtain low raw material prices, reduce storage cost, reduce insurance cost, and reduce taxes. For a final project for my Database Design class.

Steps:
- picked a topic idea
- asked "what functions should the system perform.
- What processes are needed for a inventory control management to work.
- -------------------------
- created a relational diagram 
- threw the diagram into forward engineering --> creating inventoryMangementDatabase.sql 
- --------------------------
- made some code that would populate and show how sql syntax can manipulate data in tables based on what was learned throughout the course. 
- --> creating databaseImplementation.sql
-
